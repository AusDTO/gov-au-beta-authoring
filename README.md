# Experimental GOV.AU Authoring Tool

This is a technology **experiment** designed to explore the way GovCMS can be used as an authoring tool for content to be published on GOV.AU.

This is GovCMS/Drupal with an added module [govau_push](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-beta-authoring/tree/master/sites/all/modules/custom/govau_push).

[govau_push](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-beta-authoring/tree/master/sites/all/modules/custom/govau_push) sends content and taxonomies to an API when they are changed. It also allows logging in to the experimental application and previewing content before it is published.

This experiment is intentionally simplistic and minimises dependencies. For example it does not use the [Content Hub](https://www.acquia.com/gb/products-services/acquia-content-hub).
