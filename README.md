# Experimental GOV.AU Authoring tool

This is GovCMS/Drupal with an added module [govau_push](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-beta-authoring/tree/master/sites/all/modules/custom/govau_push) which is used for experimental spikes in https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-beta

[govau_push](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-beta-authoring/tree/master/sites/all/modules/custom/govau_push) sends content and taxonomies to an API when they are changed. It also allows logging in to the experimental application and previewing content before it is published.
